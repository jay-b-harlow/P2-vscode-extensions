VSCode support for the Propeller languages: Spin2 and Pasm2 for the [Parallax Inc.](https://parallax.com) Propeller 2 [P2 or P2X8C4M64P](https://propeller.parallax.com/p2.html). The P2 community thrives in the [P2 Forums](https://forums.parallax.com/categories/propeller-2-multicore-microcontroller)

The **P2 Forum Thread** containing discussion of [this VSCode support](https://forums.parallax.com/discussion/170068/visual-studio-code-editor-for-p1-p2-spin-pasm#latest)

## Features

- **Syntax highlighting** for both Spin2 and Pasm2 including all Streamer and Smart-pin Symbols
- **Semantic Highlighting** for both Spin2 and Pasm2 now fully working
- File navigation from **Outline View**
- **Manual Code Formatting** supports alignment to spin2-custom tab stops
- **Manual Code Formatting** supports project-specific spin2-custom tab stops
- Works with your favorite VSCode themes
- Offers companion Theme (Two themes: Syntax+Semantic, and Syntax only - mostly used during semantic highlighting development)

### Up next
- Build and Download support (using external compiler(s) and download tool(s)) - *Still figuring this out but follow along with me as I drop HOW-TOs in [Configuring Tasks](TASKS.md)*

### Future directions

- Task Provider - *studies the current environment and offers to write the tasks for a given P2 project*
- Spin2/Pasm2 code formatter/beautifier - *allows us to have standard formatting for code we share! (source code could be formatted on each file save)*
- Snippets for Spin2/Pasm2 (common code sequences which can be added easily to file being edited (e.g., smart pin setup code for given mode/use)
- Possible Extension Package for P2 (would include all P2 specific extensions)

## Installation

In VSCode search for the "spin2" extension and install it.  It's that easy!  After installation you will be notified to download and install a new version as new versions are released.

## VSCode Environment

There are two companion documents in this Repository:

1. [Configuring Tasks](TASKS.md) which advises on how to automate your P2 Development when using VScode
2. [VSCode Extensions](EXTENSIONS.md) we find useful in our own P2 development

Also, here are a couple of really useful VSCode sources:

- [VSCode can do that?](https://www.vscodecandothat.com/) Fun website showing specific things VSCode can do - review whats possible that may help you in your use of VSCode.
- YouTube Channel: [Code 2020](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyYh-eAr74avLwOyPa1dDNg) - A large list of short videos presenting all manner of useful VSCode tips.

*Please go look at each of these once so you can know what's here when you need them!*

## Repository Notes

This repository contains two subprojects. Each of which are vscode extensions:

- SPIN2 and PASM2 syntax Highlighting and code navigation [spin2](./spin2) - *Builds*
- SPIN1 and PASM1 syntax highlighting [spin1](./spin1) - *DOES NOT BUILD*

*Each of these two are self contained and package their own extension but spin1 will be migrated into spin2 shortly*

## Credits

Ray [Cluso99] in our [Propeller 2 Forums](https://forums.parallax.com/categories/propeller-2-multicore-microcontroller) which started this effort for us.

Patrick (GitHub [Entomy](https://github.com/Entomy)) for a spin1 extension which helped me get further along with this one.


## Older install info (for reference only)

If you had downloaded the .vsix.zip from our [Propeller 2 Forum thread](https://forums.parallax.com/discussion/170068/visual-studio-code-editor-for-p1-amp-p2-spin-amp-pasm#latest) then skip to the next section "**Load Extention into vscode**".

While it's no longer needed, we still maintain our [Releases Page](https://github.com/ironsheep/P2-vscode-extensions/releases).

### Manually Load Extension into vscode

Now that you have downloaded the .vsix.zip file simply unzip it to get the .vsix file.

Open a Command window (on linux, macos, rpi open a terminal window) and cd to the directory containing this file. 

Execute this command:

```bash
code --install-extension {filename}.vsix
```

*(replacing {filename} with the name of your file, of course.)*

After restarting VSCode you should be ready to start editing spin2 code.  Enjoy!

NOTE: to activate one of the experimental themes distributed with this extension using Ctl-K Ctl-T (on macOS Cmd-K, Cmd-T) and select "Spin2 Ironsheep" or "Spin2 Cluso99".  Of course, your favorte themes should work as well.
